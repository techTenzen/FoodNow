✅ How to Test Role-Based Access
Here’s how you can test that the new security rule is working correctly.

Test 1: Access Denied for a Regular User
Register a new user (or use "alice@example.com" if she's still in your database). This user will have the CUSTOMER role.

Log in as the CUSTOMER user (alice@example.com) to get a JWT token.

Try to access the admin endpoint with that token.

Request:

Method: GET

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/admin/dashboard

Headers:

Authorization: Bearer <token_from_customer_login>

Expected Response:

Status: 403 Forbidden

This proves that users without the ADMIN role cannot access the endpoint.

Test 2: Access Granted for the Admin User
Log in as the default admin user.

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login

Body:

JSON

{
    "email": "admin@foodnow.com",
    "password": "admin123"
}
You will receive a new JWT token for the admin.

Access the admin endpoint using the admin's token.

Request:

Method: GET

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/admin/dashboard

Headers:

Authorization: Bearer <token_from_admin_login>

Expected Response:

Status: 200 OK

Body:

JSON

{
    "message": "Welcome to the Admin Dashboard!"
}

Action: A logged-in CUSTOMER applies to open a restaurant.

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/admin/applications/{applicationId}/reject

Action: A newly approved RESTAURANT_OWNER adds an item to their menu.

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/restaurant/menu

Headers: Authorization: Bearer <new_owner_token> (This required logging in again as the user to get a token with the updated role).

Body:

JSON

{
    "name": "Chicken Tikka Masala",
    "description": "Grilled chicken chunks in a spiced curry sauce.",
    "price": 400.00
}
Result: 200 OK with a clean JSON response of the FoodItemDto.



Test 1: Get a List of All Restaurants
This test checks if the API can publicly show all available restaurants.

Open Postman.

Set the Method: GET

Enter the URL: http://localhost:8080/api/public/restaurants

Click "Send".

✅ Expected Result: You should get a 200 OK status. The response body will be a JSON array containing a list of all the restaurants in your system, formatted cleanly by your RestaurantDto.

Test 2: Get the Menu for a Specific Restaurant
This test checks if you can view the menu for a single restaurant.

Get a Restaurant ID: Look at the response from Test 1 and find the id of one of the restaurants (e.g., 2).

Set the Method: GET

Enter the URL: http://localhost:8080/api/public/restaurants/{restaurantId}/menu (replace {restaurantId} with the actual ID, for example: http://localhost:8080/api/public/restaurants/2/menu).

Here is the testing plan for the new payment processing endpoint.

Prerequisites
Have a Pending Order: You must have an order with a PENDING status in your database. To get one, follow the "Customer Ordering Workflow" from our previous test plan:

Log in as a customer.

Add an item to the cart.

Place the order.

Note the id of the new order from the response.

Get the Customer's Token: Make sure you have the JWT accessToken for the same customer who placed the pending order.

Test: Process a Payment for an Order
Action: The customer initiates a payment for the order they just created.

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/payments/process

Headers: Authorization: Bearer <customer_token>

Body: (Use the orderId you noted from the prerequisite step)

JSON

{
    "orderId": 3 
}
Result: You should get a 200 OK status. The response body will be a PaymentDto showing the details of the transaction.

The status will be either SUCCESSFUL or FAILED (since our service logic is random).

You will see a unique transactionId.

Verification
After the test, check your database to confirm the changes:

Check the payments table: You will see a new row for the transaction you just processed.

Check the orders table: Find the order you paid for. If the payment was successful, its status will now be updated from PENDING to CONFIRMED.
