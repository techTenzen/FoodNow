‚úÖ How to Test Role-Based Access
Here‚Äôs how you can test that the new security rule is working correctly.

Test 1: Access Denied for a Regular User
Register a new user (or use "alice@example.com" if she's still in your database). This user will have the CUSTOMER role.

Log in as the CUSTOMER user (alice@example.com) to get a JWT token.

Try to access the admin endpoint with that token.

Request:

Method: GET

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/admin/dashboard

Headers:

Authorization: Bearer <token_from_customer_login>

Expected Response:

Status: 403 Forbidden

This proves that users without the ADMIN role cannot access the endpoint.

Test 2: Access Granted for the Admin User
Log in as the default admin user.

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login

Body:

JSON

{
    "email": "admin@foodnow.com",
    "password": "admin123"
}
You will receive a new JWT token for the admin.

Access the admin endpoint using the admin's token.

Request:

Method: GET

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/admin/dashboard

Headers:

Authorization: Bearer <token_from_admin_login>

Expected Response:

Status: 200 OK

Body:

JSON

{
    "message": "Welcome to the Admin Dashboard!"
}

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/restaurant/menu

    "description": "Grilled chicken chunks in a spiced curry sauce.",
    "price": 400.00

Here is the testing plan for the new payment processing endpoint.

Prerequisites
Have a Pending Order: You must have an order with a PENDING status in your database. To get one, follow the "Customer Ordering Workflow" from our previous test plan:

Log in as a customer.

Add an item to the cart.

Place the order.

Note the id of the new order from the response.

Get the Customer's Token: Make sure you have the JWT accessToken for the same customer who placed the pending order.

Test: Process a Payment for an Order
Action: The customer initiates a payment for the order they just created.

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:8080/api/payments/process

Headers: Authorization: Bearer <customer_token>

Body: (Use the orderId you noted from the prerequisite step)

JSON

{
    "orderId": 3 
}
Result: You should get a 200 OK status. The response body will be a PaymentDto showing the details of the transaction.

The status will be either SUCCESSFUL or FAILED (since our service logic is random).

You will see a unique transactionId.

Verification
After the test, check your database to confirm the changes:

Check the payments table: You will see a new row for the transaction you just processed.

Check the orders table: Find the order you paid for. If the payment was successful, its status will now be updated from PENDING to CONFIRMED.
